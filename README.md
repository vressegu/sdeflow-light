# Multiplicative Score-based Generative model (MSGM)

This code implement SGM and MSGM as proposed in :
>  Gruhlke, R., Resseguier, V., & Talla, M.. "Multiplicative Diffusion Models: Beyond Gaussian Latents". ICLR 2026

### How it works
Here's an example command line for running an experiment

```
python MSGM_higherDim.py
```
